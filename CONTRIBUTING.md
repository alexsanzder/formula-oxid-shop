# How to Contribute

Yeay! You want to contribute to commitlint. That's amazing! To smoothen everyone's experience involved with the project please take note of the following guidelines and rules.

## Contributor Behavior

tldr; we value constructive community interaction, over technical acumen.

## Pull Requests

Formula Oxid Storefront use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork the Formula Oxid Storefront repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
